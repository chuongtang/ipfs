# IPFS
IPFS is a decentralized, peer to peer file sharing protocol. Essentially it's a distributed file system over blockchain

There are various types of IPFS gateways available. Some are free, some are not. 

In this project, I've used [Infura](https://infura.io/product/overview) which allow write access

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
